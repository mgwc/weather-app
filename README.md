# weather-app

Basic weather app built for practice using Node and Express.

Will use Google Places Autocomplete API to get standardized location inputs
from the user, and will query OpenWeather API for current weather data.

## setup

After cloning the repository, please run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the server. The app will start on `localhost:3000` and you'll be able to use it via your browser.
